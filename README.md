At the moment, Crestron does not provide an easy and secure way to post videos recorded with a Crestron Capture HD to any LMS. Kiwipie fills this void by using the LTI standard to help prevent sharing of videos outside of the intended audience, and gives users the appearance of never leaving the LMS. 

To run this project you will need:
Php
Mysql
Wowza server
Crestron Roomview Fusion
apache (running https)

For a how-to on installing kiwipie, look at the wiki.
